This prototype app is intended to store products from different websites which want to be purchased or viewed later and tracks the price drops of products saved to the app, sending notifications each time the cost drops. Currently, the app contains most of the UI elements, but it needs to be updated for the rest of the above functions. The app has a tab bar item, with 4 tabs: home, trending, my items, and explore. The Home page displays a slide show of various products. The trending page should show products that have been frequently saved via the app among all users. The my items page should store products in a collection view. Finally, the explore page possess various brands to explore, with the link provided to each store. Note: The UI elements have not been adjusted in portrait and landscape modes for the iphone 6 plus and 7plus as well as iphone 8 and other newer models.
